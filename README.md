## Welcome to Community Housing and Training (CHT) Programs

'A MULTIFACETED, COMPREHENSIVE and INNOVATIVE Program, a truly responsive program in today’s complex driven environment with the provision of VOCATIONAL or OCCUPATIONAL SKILLS and EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT as well as VALUES FORMATION for STRONG FAITH in GOD and SELF-WORTH as HUMAN BEING with DIGNITY.'

# Program and Project Rationale

'The prevailing condition of the educational system in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) paints a vivid picture that it lags behind in various aspects compared to the other administrative regions in the Philippines.'

'To a large extent, the underpinning grounds to this appalling state of education can be pointed mainly to the adverse and complex effects of the armed conflict that beset the region compounded by the rising criminalities and lawlessness, high incidence of poverty, poor delivery of and access to basic social services and the inadequate education budget from the national coffer.'

'Devastating and cruel, indeed, were the effects of the armed conflict, particularly the all-out wars of 2000 and 2003, to the educational system in the ARMM as well as to the delivery of the basic social services. The already dilapidated physical facilities and infrastructures were further demolished, number of drop outs continuously increases and the enrolment rates in both elementary and secondary levels went down tremendously due to the armed conflict.'

'It must be underlined that these wars had also rendered multifaceted traumatic experiences to the children, pupils, students of the ARMM, a focus and effective psychosocial intervention and debriefing program, therefore, must be instituted to address the said reality.'

'It has been said that the key to socio-economic development that would eventually diminish the abject poverty and underdevelopment as well as the armed conflict in the war-ravaged autonomous region is through educational advancement at all levels. But how can that be achieved if the aforementioned underpinning reasons to the appalling state of education in the ARMM will not be squarely responded to immediately by concerned institutions?'

'In the recent study of education in Mindanao, ARMM registered lowest in basic and functional literacy, secondary participation rate, elementary cohort survival rate and highest elementary drop-out rate. The basic and functional literacy rate is lowest at 61%. The secondary participation rate is also lowest at 39.19%. The elementary cohort survival is also modest at 33.96%. The elementary drop out at its meanest at 23.86%. (DepEd-ARMM Publication: Leading a New Beginning)'

'This dismal state of education in ARMM is equally true in most parts of its component provinces - Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi and Basilan. In fact, 21% of its 2,445 Barangays are without schools, which deprive the constituency of access to education.'

'**Hence, this COMMUNITY HOUSING AND TRAINING (CHT) PROGRAM project proposal aims to provide access to basic education among the children, functional literacy, and livelihood for the parents and community-based education and learning facilities. It is an initiative that vigorously complements the overall thrusts and efforts to strengthen the basic education program of the government and particularly in the ARMM.**'

'The **CHT Program** will also provide **OCCUPATIONAL SKILLS TRAINING** for unskilled individuals and members of the family in order to enhance and to develop their capabilities and skills to augment their family income as well as **BASIC EDUCATIONAL SERVICES** outside of the formal school for less in education and school-age children and **LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT COUNSELING** and **VALUES FORMATION** for strong faith in God and individual's self-worth and dignity as human being and can be productive members of the society.'

'This proposal budget in the amount of **PhP 1,704,000.00** for Non-Housing and Administrative Components of the CHT Program will be sourced out in the form of solicitation for program’s assistance to generous and interested Donors, who are willing to help us for these charitable activities. We anticipate the said assistance from the Donors which will be an **ESSENTIAL** and **PRIMARY** part of our program that permits our efforts in the field of **SKILLS TRAINING, EDUCATION, SOCIAL SERVICES, COUNSELING and VALUES FORMATION activities**.'

'The program which we ENVISION is **MULTIFACETED** (*means having a variety of different and important features or elements of the program, from sheltering, educational services, occupational/livelihood skills training and social services including counseling and values formation for strong faith in God and individual's  self-worth as human being*), **COMPREHENSIVE** (*means something that includes everything that is needed or relevant, programs that are complementary to each other in a typical community from educational, economic to social services*) and **INNOVATIVE** (*something that is new and original, programs’ approaches which are more innovative than those of their competitions, like; approaches to educational services outside of the formal school, It introduces changes and new ideas which are believed to be effective in today’s complex driven environment*).'

'The organization has already identified and acquired a 2-hectare land area for the housing site as a component of this program through our initiatives and voluntary contributions.'

'Although, we have generous friends within the community support our programs, however due to the overall cumulative effect of the economy, we have been unable to secure the essential funding for the **Community Housing and Training (CHT) Programs and Projects**.'

'With this reality, I decided to open another window of opportunities to seek any amount as voluntary contribution and support for the **Community Housing and Training (CHT) Program** from a generous friend like you with heart for charitable activities. I strongly believed when your 1 Peso is added to my 1 Peso and added to our 1 Peso would be a big deal for the success of CHT Programs and Projects, and thus is a part for the realization of program's **Vision**, **Mission** and **Goals**.'

'The housing component will provide aid not only to those families requiring assisted housing but also to those families who are direct beneficiaries of non-housing component of the CHT program. We anticipate that percentage of the units will be set aside for **Learning Centers**, **Values Formation Center**, **Multi-Purpose Center** and **Office**.'

# Project Approach and Design Strategy Framework

'**A framework of tri-sectoral partnership will need to be developed in support of COMMUNITY HOUSING AND TRAINING PROGRAM'S PROJECT. Partnership building through networking and advocacy amongst the Local Government Unit (LGU), People's Organizations and the business sector will be encouraged and promoted for ownership and sustainability. Target beneficiaries participation and involvement result in mobilizing resources, sharing responsibilities and establishing a sense of ownership to sustain community development activities**.'

'In line with the Government's policy of supporting poverty alleviation through empowering the capacities of local population, the Project will be **(i) be community-based**; **(ii) employ existing interagency coordinative mechanisms**; and **(iii) effectively utilized existing line structure of government agencies; particularly DepEd to provide appropriate support to the community-based NFE programs**.  COMMUNITY HOUSING AND TRAINING PROGRAM'S PROJECT would enable to expand non-formal basic educational services to the poor and marginalized communities by harnessing the considerable existing capacities and experiences of organization resources to ensure relevance, appropriateness and sustainability of the non-formal education services.'

'The project would advocate and promote the forging of alliances and partnerships between and amongst community organizations, its Local Government Unit (LGU) and National Government Agencies (NGAs), Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) and Civil Society Organizations (CSOs).'

# Project Beneficiaries and Stakeholders

'By raising the educational achievements of the poor illiterate population, the project will contribute to poverty alleviation through the inculcation of self-reliance and self-help capacities enabling them to participate in productive activities manage their limited resources better and reduce their dependencies on welfare and dole-outs. Increased functional literacy among parents would also improve school retention rate among their children and ensure that their children remain in school and attain higher levels of learning. In general terms, children whose parents have at least a basic education tend to do better in school than children whose parents have had little or no education. Studies have also shown a high correlation on literacy and education to lower birth rates, improve family health care, lower infant and maternal mortality rates.'

'The identification of target groups (learners) will be undertaken by means of a literacy mapping and the interagency consultative process. Those to be selected are the areas with high literacy rates, low participation rate in schools and high incidence of poverty. **The priority groups are: (i) victims of armed conflict who are illiterate and functionally illiterate Out-of-School Youths (OSYs) and adults; and (ii) functionally literate OSYs and adults who have expressed interest to pursue continuing education programs (CEPs) or into vocational entrepreneurship trainings. Priority consideration should be given to girls and women from the poorest households and members of cultural minority groups**.'

'These beneficiaries will be identified, recruited and selected with the assistance of Local Government Unit (LGU) and Coordinators in the areas.'

'Identified areas and their leaders will be tasked to assist in the recruitment, selection of target beneficiary groups. The barangay unit, together with other leaders (social and religious) will be organized and trained as COMMUNITY HOUSING AND TRAINING PROGRAM'S PROJECT community-based partners.'

'Their involvement in the planning, recruitment and selection of learners/trainees, and the monitoring and evaluation process will develop in them a "sense of partnership and ownership" on the project. This is also a significant step towards community involvement and ultimately in the sustainability of the project in the grassroots level.'

# Description of Project Components

'The **COMMUNITY HOUSING AND TRAINING PROGRAM'S PROJECT** will have **five (5) inter-related and mutually supportive components**. The **Assisted Housing** will provide aid to those families requiring assisted housing.

# Program's Needs and Appeal

'**DONATION APPEAL**'

'For'

'**Community Housing and Training (CHT) Programs & Projects**'

'Dear **Friends**:'

'Greetings of **PEACE**.'

'I am one of the Government Secondary School Teachers of the Department of Education-Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (DepEd-ARMM) and Chief Executive Officer of Kambantangan Sa Kapagungaya Peace Advocates, Incorporated (KKPAI) registered as Non-Stock, Non-Profit Non-Government Organization with special program on Community Housing and Training (CHT) Program.'

'Before I joined government service in 2007, I have been College Professor of Cotabato City State Polytechnic College, Mindanao Capitol College, Headstart College of Criminology, SKIA Foundation College,  School Principal of SKI Academy, Co-Founder and Coordinator of UKPU Urban Poor Association and BOD’s Chairman and CEO KK Peace Advocates, Incorporated.'

'What prompted me interested to be of service to the needs and concerns of the poor sector of our society particularly those real victims of man-made calamity especially of armed conflict mostly innocent children, youth and their families, is out of my first hand experience and feelings during my stay in areas mostly populated by this sector particularly in conflict affected areas in some part of North Cotabato, Maguindanao and in some barangays in this city where they are forced to evacuate and lived with their extended relatives.'

'During my stay in these areas, I witnessed the condition of the poor, the internally displaced families which can be described as BACKWARD, CONFUSED, DEPRESSED and MARGINALIZED. Their situation is wanting and challenging. THIS IS THE CONTEXT WHEREBY I DECIDED TO DEVOTE MY EXTRA TIMES, EFFORTS AND INITIATIVES TO THE BEST I COULD IN THE SERVICE TO THE NEEDS OF THE POOR SECTOR OF THE SOCIETY..'

'I observed that the children are the most vulnerable and affected sector of the society. I saw the need to develop a program that will respond to the needs of the children, particularly on the aspect of education, housing for the homeless families who are the victims and collateral damage of armed conflict, livelihood/occupational skills training for the unskilled families and youth, values formation for individual’s self-worth as human beings.'

'At the outset, I conceptualized the program and invited some friends for a table discussion and eventually supported the program after they have understood the very objective of the program for the poor and since these friends are benevolent with hearts for the conditions of the poor.'

## The Emergence of Community Housing and Training (CHT) Program

'So the Community Housing and Training (CHT) Program emerged. The CHT Program can simply be described as  MULTIFACETED (means having a variety of different and important features or elements of the program, from sheltering, educational services, occupational/livelihood skills training and social services including counseling and values formation for self-worth as human being), COMPREHENSIVE (means something that includes everything that is needed or relevant, programs that are complementary to each other in a typical community from educational, economic to social services) and INNOVATIVE (something that is new and original, programs’ approaches which are more innovative than those of their competitions, like; approaches to educational services outside of the formal school, It introduces changes and new ideas which are believed to be effective in today’s complex driven environment). No other organizations in the area offer such programs.'

'I am appealing with prayers and hope that we could be an instruments in finding resource support opportunities for these programs and projects that could help our low-income earner families particularly the poorest of the poor, less in education, unskilled, living with extended relatives and no permanent house, affected and displaced by armed conflict between the government troops and rebel groups in neighboring areas.'

'Until now, we have generous individuals, friends within the community support our programs, however due to the overall cumulative effect of the economy, we have been unable to secure the essential funding for the Community Housing and Training (CHT) Programs and Projects.'

'With this reality, I opened this window of opportunities to seek any amount as voluntary contribution and support for the COMMUNITY HOUSING and TRAINING (CHT) PROGRAM from a generous friend like you with heart for charitable activities. I strongly believed when your 1 Peso is added to my 1 Peso and added to our 1 Peso would be a big deal for the successful implementation of CHT Programs and Projects, and could HELP, SAVE and GIVE A NEW HOPES for the needy sectors of our society.'

'With our collective efforts and your generous donations towards the Projects of the Community Housing and Training (CHT) Program a truly responsive programs for the needy sectors of our society under the today’s complex driven environment, we could HELP the dignity and self-worth of poor homeless families, SAVE the children and youth from the threats of exploitation, and GIVE A NEW HOPES for children and their families through education and other social services'

'With prayers and hopes, we could be an instruments in bridging an opportunities to the needy and less privilege sectors of the society under the today’s complex driven environment.'

'On behalf of the beneficiaries we serve, thank you for your time and considerations. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions regarding our programs and projects or how your donations help us. We will be happy to answer your questions.'
