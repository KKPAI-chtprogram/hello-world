## Welcome to Community Housing and Training (CHT) Programs

'A MULTIFACETED, COMPREHENSIVE and INNOVATIVE Program, a truly responsive program in today’s complex driven environment with the provision of VOCATIONAL or OCCUPATIONAL SKILLS and EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT as well as VALUES FORMATION for STRONG FAITH in GOD and SELF-WORTH as HUMAN BEING with DIGNITY.'

# Program and Project Rationale

'The prevailing condition of the educational system in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) paints a vivid picture that it lags behind in various aspects compared to the other administrative regions in the Philippines.'

'To a large extent, the underpinning grounds to this appalling state of education can be pointed mainly to the adverse and complex effects of the armed conflict that beset the region compounded by the rising criminalities and lawlessness, high incidence of poverty, poor delivery of and access to basic social services and the inadequate education budget from the national coffer.'

'Devastating and cruel, indeed, were the effects of the armed conflict, particularly the all-out wars of 2000 and 2003, to the educational system in the ARMM as well as to the delivery of the basic social services. The already dilapidated physical facilities and infrastructures were further demolished, number of drop outs continuously increases and the enrolment rates in both elementary and secondary levels went down tremendously due to the armed conflict.'

'It must be underlined that these wars had also rendered multifaceted traumatic experiences to the children, pupils, students of the ARMM, a focus and effective psychosocial intervention and debriefing program, therefore, must be instituted to address the said reality.'

'It has been said that the key to socio-economic development that would eventually diminish the abject poverty and underdevelopment as well as the armed conflict in the war-ravaged autonomous region is through educational advancement at all levels. But how can that be achieved if the aforementioned underpinning reasons to the appalling state of education in the ARMM will not be squarely responded to immediately by concerned institutions?'

'In the recent study of education in Mindanao, ARMM registered lowest in basic and functional literacy, secondary participation rate, elementary cohort survival rate and highest elementary drop-out rate. The basic and functional literacy rate is lowest at 61%. The secondary participation rate is also lowest at 39.19%. The elementary cohort survival is also modest at 33.96%. The elementary drop out at its meanest at 23.86%. (DepEd-ARMM Publication: Leading a New Beginning)'

'This dismal state of education in ARMM is equally true in most parts of its component provinces - Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi and Basilan. In fact, 21% of its 2,445 Barangays are without schools, which deprive the constituency of access to education.'

'**Hence, this COMMUNITY HOUSING AND TRAINING (CHT) PROGRAM project proposal aims to provide access to basic education among the children, functional literacy, and livelihood for the parents and community-based education and learning facilities. It is an initiative that vigorously complements the overall thrusts and efforts to strengthen the basic education program of the government and particularly in the ARMM.**'

'The **CHT Program** will also provide **OCCUPATIONAL SKILLS TRAINING** for unskilled individuals and members of the family in order to enhance and to develop their capabilities and skills to augment their family income as well as **BASIC EDUCATIONAL SERVICES** outside of the formal school for less in education and school-age children and **LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT COUNSELING** and **VALUES FORMATION** for strong faith in God and individual's self-worth and dignity as human being and can be productive members of the society.'

'This proposal budget in the amount of **PhP 1,704,000.00** for Non-Housing and Administrative Components of the CHT Program will be sourced out in the form of solicitation for program’s assistance to generous and interested Donors, who are willing to help us for these charitable activities. We anticipate the said assistance from the Donors which will be an **ESSENTIAL** and **PRIMARY** part of our program that permits our efforts in the field of **SKILLS TRAINING, EDUCATION, SOCIAL SERVICES, COUNSELING and VALUES FORMATION activities**.'

'The program which we ENVISION is **MULTIFACETED** (*means having a variety of different and important features or elements of the program, from sheltering, educational services, occupational/livelihood skills training and social services including counseling and values formation for strong faith in God and individual's  self-worth as human being*), **COMPREHENSIVE** (*means something that includes everything that is needed or relevant, programs that are complementary to each other in a typical community from educational, economic to social services*) and **INNOVATIVE** (*something that is new and original, programs’ approaches which are more innovative than those of their competitions, like; approaches to educational services outside of the formal school, It introduces changes and new ideas which are believed to be effective in today’s complex driven environment*).'

'The organization has already identified and acquired a 2-hectare land area for the housing site as a component of this program through our initiatives and voluntary contributions.'

'Although, we have generous friends within the community support our programs, however due to the overall cumulative effect of the economy, we have been unable to secure the essential funding for the **Community Housing and Training (CHT) Programs and Projects**.'

'With this reality, I decided to open another window of opportunities to seek any amount as voluntary contribution and support for the **Community Housing and Training (CHT) Program** from a generous friend like you with heart for charitable activities. I strongly believed when your 1 Peso is added to my 1 Peso and added to our 1 Peso would be a big deal for the success of CHT Programs and Projects, and thus is a part for the realization of program's **Vision**, **Mission** and **Goals**.'

'The housing component will provide aid not only to those families requiring assisted housing but also to those families who are direct beneficiaries of non-housing component of the CHT program. We anticipate that percentage of the units will be set aside for **Learning Centers**, **Values Formation Center**, **Multi-Purpose Center** and **Office**.'

# Project Approach and Design Strategy Framework

'**A framework of tri-sectoral partnership will need to be developed in support of COMMUNITY HOUSING AND TRAINING PROGRAM'S PROJECT. Partnership building through networking and advocacy amongst the Local Government Unit (LGU), People's Organizations and the business sector will be encouraged and promoted for ownership and sustainability. Target beneficiaries participation and involvement result in mobilizing resources, sharing responsibilities and establishing a sense of ownership to sustain community development activities**.'

'In line with the Government's policy of supporting poverty alleviation through empowering the capacities of local population, the Project will be **(i) be community-based**; **(ii) employ existing interagency coordinative mechanisms**; and **(iii) effectively utilized existing line structure of government agencies; particularly DepEd to provide appropriate support to the community-based NFE programs**.  COMMUNITY HOUSING AND TRAINING PROGRAM'S PROJECT would enable to expand non-formal basic educational services to the poor and marginalized communities by harnessing the considerable existing capacities and experiences of organization resources to ensure relevance, appropriateness and sustainability of the non-formal education services.'

'The project would advocate and promote the forging of alliances and partnerships between and amongst community organizations, its Local Government Unit (LGU) and National Government Agencies (NGAs), Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) and Civil Society Organizations (CSOs).'

# Project Beneficiaries and Stakeholders

'By raising the educational achievements of the poor illiterate population, the project will contribute to poverty alleviation through the inculcation of self-reliance and self-help capacities enabling them to participate in productive activities manage their limited resources better and reduce their dependencies on welfare and dole-outs. Increased functional literacy among parents would also improve school retention rate among their children and ensure that their children remain in school and attain higher levels of learning. In general terms, children whose parents have at least a basic education tend to do better in school than children whose parents have had little or no education. Studies have also shown a high correlation on literacy and education to lower birth rates, improve family health care, lower infant and maternal mortality rates.'

'The identification of target groups (learners) will be undertaken by means of a literacy mapping and the interagency consultative process. Those to be selected are the areas with high literacy rates, low participation rate in schools and high incidence of poverty. **The priority groups are: (i) victims of armed conflict who are illiterate and functionally illiterate Out-of-School Youths (OSYs) and adults; and (ii) functionally literate OSYs and adults who have expressed interest to pursue continuing education programs (CEPs) or into vocational entrepreneurship trainings. Priority consideration should be given to girls and women from the poorest households and members of cultural minority groups**.'

'These beneficiaries will be identified, recruited and selected with the assistance of Local Government Unit (LGU) and Coordinators in the areas.'

'Identified areas and their leaders will be tasked to assist in the recruitment, selection of target beneficiary groups. The barangay unit, together with other leaders (social and religious) will be organized and trained as COMMUNITY HOUSING AND TRAINING PROGRAM'S PROJECT community-based partners.'

'Their involvement in the planning, recruitment and selection of learners/trainees, and the monitoring and evaluation process will develop in them a "sense of partnership and ownership" on the project. This is also a significant step towards community involvement and ultimately in the sustainability of the project in the grassroots level.'

# Background

## The Emergence of the COMMUNITY HOUSING AND TRAINING (CHT) PROGRAM

'The emergence of the **COMMUNITY HOUSING AND TRAINING (CHT) PROGRAM** is out of our social concerns on the low-income earner families particularly who were affected by armed conflicts between the gov’t troops and rebel groups, who are living with extended relatives, no permanent house and anywhere in this city and nearby areas, who are classified as low-income earners, with less education and livelihood skills and through series of studies with a group of Professionals and friends from different sectors of society but with one common objective; to help the needy.'

'The **Community Housing and Training (CHT) Program** is instrumental in establishing and providing programs for housing, social services, education and skills training for its members.'

'It is a primary source of essential services and administers comprehensive programs involving social services, health, education, occupational and assisted housing.'

'It provides fundamental social services involving counseling and values formation in a variety of social, health and family related programs.'

'1. It **primarily provides a range of direct hands-on member services** including but not limited to counselling and referral on assisted housing, social security, skills training, educational services and healthcare;'

'2. It **fundamentally directed towards planning and development** with an emphasis on housing development, livelihood skills training and organizational development; and'

'1. **Know & believe that God is in-charge**: Make intentions and leave the rest to Him. Allow him to operate through you. Obey Him because He is our gracious Master and we are His grateful servants.'

'2. **Start small and build upon it**: The strongest house is where the foundation is placed one layer at a time allowing for the first to solidify before the second is laid on. This is how the organization operates. Although it makes for a slow process, nonetheless the product is sounder.'

'3. **The power of sincere initiative**: We believe in the power of sincere initiative and then when 3-5 sincere hearts unite on the same purpose, tremendous change for the good can be brought in a society.'
