## Welcome to Community Housing and Training (CHT) Programs

# Program Summary

'Kambantangan Sa Kapagongaya Peace Advocates, Inc. through its **Community Housing and Training (CHT) Program** initiates a low-cost housing project in the targeted area at Barangay Tamontaka 5, Cotabato City for its homeless members mostly low-income earner families particularly the poor who were affected and displaced because of the armed conflict between the government troops and rebel groups, living with extended relatives and informal settlers residing in the highly congested poor areas which could hardly be called a homes in this city.'

'The **CHT Program** will also provide occupational skills training for unskilled individuals and members of the family in order to enhance and to develop their capabilities and skills to augment their family income as well as basic educational services for less in education and school-age children and leadership development counseling and values formation for self-worth and dignity as human being and can be productive members of the society.'

'This proposal budget in the amount of PhP 1,704,000.00 for Non-Housing and Administrative Components of the CHT Program will be sourced out in the form of solicitation for program’s assistance to generous and interested Donors (Individuals and Groups, Philanthropists) who are willing to help us for these charitable activities. We anticipate the said assistance from the Donors which will be an essential and primary part of our program that permits our efforts in the field of skills training, education, social services, counseling and values formation.'

'The program which we **ENVISION** is **multifaceted** (*means having a variety of different and important features or elements of the program, from sheltering, educational services, occupational/livelihood skills training and social services including counseling and values formation for self-worth as human being*), **comprehensive** (*means something that includes everything that is needed or relevant, programs that are complementary to each other in a typical community from educational, economic to social services*) and **innovative** (*something that is new and original, programs’ approaches which are more innovative than those of their competitions, like; approaches to educational services outside of the formal school, It introduces changes and new ideas which are believed to be effective in today’s complex driven environment*).' 

'The organization has already identified and acquired a 2-hectare land area for the housing site as a component of this program through our initiatives and voluntary contributions.'

'Although, we have generous friends within the community support our programs, however due to the overall cumulative effect of the economy, we have been unable to secure the essential funding for the **Community Housing and Training (CHT) Programs and Projects**.'

'With this reality, I decided to open another window of opportunities to seek any amount as voluntary contribution and  support for the COMMUNITY HOUSING AND TRAINING (CHT) PROGRAM from a generous friend like you with heart for charitable activities. I strongly believed when your 1 Peso is added to my 1 Peso and added to our 1 Peso would be a big deal for the continuous implementation of CHT Programs and Projects, and thus be a part for the realization of program's Vision, Mission and Goals.'

'The housing component will provide aid not only to those families requiring assisted housing but also to those families who are direct beneficiaries of non-housing component of the CHT program. We anticipate that percentage of the units will be set aside for **school buildings, values formation center, multi-purpose center and office**.'
